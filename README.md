# US_states

The "US STATE GAME" is a Python program that combines turtle graphics and data processing to create an interactive game using pandas library.
The game presents a blank map of the United States and prompts the user to guess the names of the states. 


How to Play

The game will display a map of the United States with the names of the states hidden.
A dialog box will prompt you to guess the name of a state. Simply type the name of the state and press Enter. The input is not case-sensitive.
If your guess is correct, the state name will be revealed on the map, and your progress will be tracked.
Continue guessing state names until you've correctly identified all 50 U.S. states or enter "Exit" to exit the game.
If you exit the game, a CSV file named "states_missed.csv" will be created, containing the names of the states you missed.
